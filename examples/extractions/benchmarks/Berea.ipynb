    "# Introduction\n",
    "This example is from our series of permeability benchmarks, mostly for making sure that `OpenPNM` can accurately predict the permeability of known rock samples. In this example, we try to calculate the permeability of an extracted pore network model form a Bentheimer sandstone rock sample. The network has already been extracted using `PoreSpy`, and so here we only load the output generated from `PoreSpy` into `OpenPNM`.\n",

For instance, the first assigned network or geometry is named \"net_01\", \"geo_01\", respectively. But let's say you didn't know about this.

    "Now, let's run `StokesFlow` algorithm on this network to calculate its permeability. Usually, in the process of network extraction, some isolated pores could exist in the final network. Having isolated pores in your network rightfully confuses `OpenPNM` as gives rise to `NaNs` in your solution. We need to get rid of those pores. To do that, first we call `check_network_health` on the network, which returns back a dictionary containing useful information regarding network health. For now, we're only interested in the the \"trim_pores\" key in that dictionary, which contains a list of pores that need to be trimmed off of the network in order for the pores to be fully connected.
