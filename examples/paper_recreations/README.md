# Paper Recreations

The examples in this directory attempt to illustrate how to re-create various journal articles from the general literature in OpenPNM. These original papers may or may not have been originally done in OpenPNM.  

> **Important Note**: These examples are quite complicated.  As such it would be too time consuming to update them each time OpenPNM changes.  Therefore, these examples all import **a specific version of OpenPNM** and utilize that.  This means they may not work exactly as illustrated with more recent versions of OpenPNM.  The version used in each example is clearly marked, and it's possible to download specific versions from the Python Package Index using ``pip install openpnm==X.Y.Z`` where ``X.Y.Z`` is the desired version number.
