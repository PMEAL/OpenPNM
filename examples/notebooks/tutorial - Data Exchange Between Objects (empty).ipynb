    "One of the features in OpenPNM is the ability to model heterogeneous materials by applying different pore-scale models to different regions.  This is done by (a) creating a unique **Geometry** object for each region (i.e. small pores vs big pores) and (b) creating unique **Physics** object for each region as well (i.e. Knudsen diffusion vs Fickian diffusion).  One consequence of this segregation of properties is that a *single* array containing values for all locations in the domain does not exist.  OpenPNM offers a shortcut for this, known as ``interleave_data``, which happens *automatically*, and makes it possible to query **Geometry** properties via the **Network** object, and **Physics** properties from the associated **Phase** object:\n",
