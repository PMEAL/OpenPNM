Having isolated pores in your network rightfully confuses `OpenPNM` as gives rise to `NaNs` in your solution. We need to get rid of those pores. To do that, first we call `check_network_health` on the network, which returns back a dictionary containing useful information regarding network health. For now, we're only interested in the the \"trim_pores\" key in that dictionary, which contains a list of pores that need to be trimmed off of the network in order for the pores to be fully connected.
