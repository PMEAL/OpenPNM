What is OpenPNM?
--------------

OpenPNM is open-source framework for conducting pore network modeling 
simulations of multiphase transport in porous materials.  It includes 
modules for generating various common network topologies, pore and 
throat geometry models, pore scale physics models, and fluid property
estimation.  It also contains a large set of algorithms for running various
simulations such drainage curves, gas diffusion, permeability, and more.  

OpenPNM is written in Python making extensive use of Scipy. Python is a very
flexible object oriented programming language that will be familiar to those
with experience using Matlab.  OpenPNM takes advantages of the OOP paradigm
to structure the framework, but we stress that it is coded by engineers 
without significant prior knowledge of object-oriented coding.  Our goal
is to help other scientists and engineers harness the power and intuitive
pore network modeling approach, so if you are interested in this package, 
please contact us through Github, or email one of the developer directly.
