    "For simulating transport in this network, we need to know lots of parameters such as pore sizes, physical properties, etc, but ultimately it comes down to knowing the conductance of the \"conduits\" in the network. For example, consider simulating Fickian diffusion in a pore network model under steady state conditions. Writing a mass balance around an arbitrary pore $i$, we have:\n",

    "where $Nb^i$ is the number of neighboring pores to pore $i$, $m_{ik}$ is the mass flow rate from pore $i$ to pore $k$, and $g_{ik}$ is the overall conductance of the conduit containing pores $i$ and $k$, and the connecting throat $ik$. Writing the mass balance for each pore, we get a linear system of $N_p$ equations (where $N_p$ is the number of pores in the network), which we can solve for the pore concentrations using a linear solver.\n",

    "Consider a conduit in a pore network model, as shown by the following figure (we assumed spherical pores and cylindrical throats, but this is not necessary):\n",

    "where L is length, A is the cross-sectional area, and the subscripts $i$, $k$, and $ik$ denote pore $i$, pore $k$, and throat $ik$. Now consider diffusional mass transfer between pore $i$ and pore $k$ with a mass flow rate of $m_{ik}$, which can be described by the following equation:\n",

    "\n",
    "where $g_{ik}$ is the diffusive conductance of the entire conduit, and $c_i$ and $c_k$ are the concentrations in pores $i$ and $k$, respectively. Note that the conduit $ik$ consists of pore $i$, throat $ik$, and pore $j$, which are connected in series. By electrical circuit analogy, the resistance (inverse of the conductance) of each element can be related to the overall resistance by the following equation:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "g_i^p = D \\frac{\\pi d_i^2/4}{\\ell_i} \\quad , \\quad g_k^p = D \\frac{\\pi d_k^2/4}{\\ell_k} \\quad , \\quad g_{ik}^t = D \\frac{\\pi d_{ik}^2/4}{\\ell_{ik}}\n",

    "In reality, however, pores/throats are not cylindrical, and the diffusive conductance needs to be **corrected**. This correction factor is called the **shape factor** in the network modeling literature, as defined by the following equation:\n",
