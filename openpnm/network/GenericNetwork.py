class GenericNetwork(Base, ModelsMixin):
    r"""
    This generic class contains the main functionality used by all networks

    Parameters
    ----------
    coords : array_like
        An Np-by-3 array of [x, y, z] coordinates for each pore.

    conns : array_like
        An Nt-by-2 array of [head, tail] connections between pores.

    Notes
    -----
    The GenericNetwork class houses a number of methods used for querying and
    managing the network's spatial and topological information.  The following
    table gives a very short overview of the methods added those already found
    on the ``openpnm.core.Base`` class.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import openpnm as op

    Create some pore coordinates and connections manually and assign to a
    GenericNetwork instance.  Consider a linear network of 4 pores and 3
    throats:

    ::

        0 ―― 1 ―― 3 ―― 2

    >>> coords = [[0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0]]
    >>> conns = [[0, 1], [1, 3], [2, 3]]
    >>> pn = op.network.GenericNetwork(conns=conns, coords=coords)

    Networks have two required properties: 'pore.coords' and 'throat.conns'.
    These arrays indicate the spatial location of each pore, and which pores
    are connected to which.  Without these the Network object cannot function.

    >>> print(pn.props())
    ――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――
    1     : pore.coords
    2     : throat.conns
    ――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――

    The GenericNetwork class has several methods for querying the topology.

    >>> Ps = pn.find_neighbor_pores(pores=1)
    >>> print(Ps)
    [0 3]
    >>> Ts = pn.find_neighbor_throats(pores=[0, 1])
    >>> print(Ts)
    [0 1]
    >>> print(pn.num_neighbors(2))
    [1]

    All of the topological queries are accomplished by inspecting the adjacency
    and incidence matrices.  They are created on demand, and are stored for
    future use to save construction time.

            If omitted, ones are used to create a standard adjacency matrix

            If ``True``, the returned sparse matrix only contains the upper-
            triangular elements.  This argument is ignored if the ``weights``
            array is 2*Nt-long.

        drop_zeros : boolean (default is ``False``)
            If ``True``, applies the ``eliminate_zeros`` method of the sparse
            array to remove all zero locations.

        Returns
        -------
        An adjacency matrix in the specified Scipy sparse format.

        Notes
        -----
        The adjacency matrix is used by OpenPNM for finding the pores
        connected to a give pore or set of pores.  Specifically, an adjacency
        matrix has Np rows and Np columns.  Each row represents a pore,
        containing non-zero values at the locations corresponding to the
        indices of the pores connected to that pore.  The ``weights`` argument
        indicates what value to place at each location, with the default
        being 1's to simply indicate connections. Another useful option is
        throat indices, such that the data values on each row indicate which
        throats are connected to the pore.

        Notes
        -----
        The incidence matrix is a cousin to the adjacency matrix, and used by
        OpenPNM for finding the throats connected to a give pore or set of
        pores.  Specifically, an incidence matrix has Np rows and Nt columns,
        and each row represents a pore, containing non-zero values at the
        locations corresponding to the indices of the throats connected to that
        pore.  The ``weights`` argument indicates what value to place at each
        location, with the default being 1's to simply indicate connections.
        Another useful option is throat indices, such that the data values
        on each row indicate which throats are connected to the pore, though
        this is redundant as it is identical to the locations of non-zeros.

        Parameters
        ----------
        throats : array_like

        flatten : boolean, optional

            **'xor'** : Only neighbors of one and only one input throat.  This

            input throats.

            **'xnor'** : Neighbors that are shared by two or more input
            throats. This is equivalent to finding all neighbors with 'or',

            that the inputs have in common.

            **'and'** : Only neighbors shared by all input throats.  This is
            also known as 'intersection' in set theory and (somtimes) as 'all'

        r"""
        Returns a list of pores that are direct neighbors to the given pore(s)

        Parameters
        ----------
        pores : array_like
            Indices of the pores whose neighbors are sought

        flatten : boolean
            If ``True`` (default) the returned result is a compressed array of
            all neighbors.  If ``False``, a list of lists with each sub-list
            containing the neighbors for each input site.  Note that an
            *unflattened* list might be slow to generate since it is a Python
            ``list`` rather than a Numpy ``array``.

        include_input : bool
            If ``False`` (default) then the input pores are not included in
            the returned list(s). Note that since pores are not neighbors of
            themselves, the neighbors of pore N will not include N, even if
            this flag is ``True``.

        mode : string
            Specifies logic to filter the resulting list.  Options are:

            **'or'** : (default) All neighbors of the input pores.  This is
            also known as the 'union' in set theory or 'any' in boolean logic.
            Both keywords are accepted and treated as 'or'.

            **'xor'** : Only neighbors of one and only one input pore.  This
            is useful for finding the pores that are not shared by any of the
            input pores.  This is known as 'exclusive_or' in set theory, and
            is an accepted input.

            **'xnor'** : Neighbors that are shared by two or more input pores.
            This is equivalent to finding all neighbors with 'or', minus those
            found with 'xor', and is useful for finding neighbors that the
            inputs have in common.

            **'and'** : Only neighbors shared by all input pores.  This is also
            known as 'intersection' in set theory and (somtimes) as 'all' in
            boolean logic.  Both keywords are accepted and treated as 'and'.

        Returns
        -------
        If ``flatten`` is ``True``, returns a 1D array of pore indices filtered
        according to the specified mode.  If ``flatten`` is ``False``, returns
        a list of lists, where each list contains the neighbors of the
        corresponding input pores.

        Notes
        -----
        The ``logic`` options are applied to neighboring pores only, thus it
        is not possible to obtain pores that are part of the global set but
        not neighbors. This is because (a) the list of global pores might be
        very large, and (b) it is not possible to return a list of neighbors
        for each input pores if global pores are considered.
