    This class contains the main functionality used by all networks.

    Parameters
    ----------
    settings : dataclass-like or dict, optional
        User defined settings for the object to override defaults. Can be a
        dataclass-type object with settings stored as attributes or a python
        dicionary of key-value pairs. Settings are stored in the ``settings``
        attribute of the object.
    name : str, optional
        A unique name to assign to the object for easier identification. If
        not given one will be generated.

    coords : array_like (optional)
        An Np-by-3 array of [x, y, z] coordinates for each pore
    conns : array_like (optional)
        An Nt-by-2 array of [head, tail] connections between pores

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import openpnm as op
    >>> import numpy as np

    Create some pore coordinates and connections manually and assign to a
    Network instance. Consider a linear network of 4 pores and 3
    throats:

    ::

        0 ―― 1 ―― 3 ―― 2

    >>> coords = np.array([[0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0]])
    >>> conns = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 3], [2, 3]])
    >>> pn = op.network.Network(conns=conns, coords=coords)

    Networks have two required properties: 'pore.coords' and
    'throat.conns'. These arrays indicate the spatial location of each
    pore, and which pores are connected to which. Without these the
    network object cannot function.

    >>> print(pn.props())
    ――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――
    1     : pore.coords
    2     : throat.conns
    ――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――

    The ``Network`` class has several methods for querying the topology.

    >>> Ps = pn.find_neighbor_pores(pores=1)
    >>> print(Ps)
    [0 3]
    >>> Ts = pn.find_neighbor_throats(pores=[0, 1])
    >>> print(Ts)
    [0 1]
    >>> print(pn.num_neighbors(2))
    [1]

    All of the topological queries are accomplished by inspecting the
    adjacency and incidence matrices. They are created on demand, and are
    stored for future use to save construction time.

        -------

        Notes
        -----
        The adjacency matrix is used by OpenPNM for finding the pores
        connected to a give pore or set of pores. Specifically, an
        adjacency matrix has Np rows and Np columns. Each row represents
        a pore, containing non-zero values at the locations corresponding
        to the indices of the pores connected to that pore. The
        ``weights`` argument indicates what value to place at each
        location, with the default being 1's to simply indicate
        connections. Another useful option is throat indices, such that
        the data values on each row indicate which throats are connected
        to the pore.

        Notes
        -----
        The incidence matrix is a cousin to the adjacency matrix, and used
        by OpenPNM for finding the throats connected to a give pore or set
        of pores. Specifically, an incidence matrix has Np rows and Nt
        columns, and each row represents a pore, containing non-zero
        values at the locations corresponding to the indices of the
        throats connected to that pore. The ``weights`` argument indicates
        what value to place at each location, with the default being 1's
        to simply indicate connections. Another useful option is throat
        indices, such that the data values on each row indicate which
        throats are connected to the pore, though this is redundant as it
        is identical to the locations of non-zeros.

            since it is a Python ``list`` rather than a Numpy ``array``.
        include_input : bool
            If ``False`` (default) then the input pores are not included
            in the returned list(s). Note that since pores are not
            neighbors of themselves, the neighbors of pore N will not
            include N, even if this flag is ``True``.
        mode : str
            Specifies logic to filter the resulting list. Options are:

            mode         meaning
            ===========  =====================================================
            'or'         All neighbors of the input pores. Also accepts 'any'
                         and 'union'.
            'xor'        Only neighbors of one and only one input pore. This
                         is useful for counting the pores that are not shared
                         by any of the input pores. Also accepts
                         'exclusive_or'.
            'xnor'       Neighbors that are shared by two or more input pores.
                         This is equivalent to counting all neighbors
                         with 'or', minus those found with 'xor', and is
                         useful for finding neighbors that the inputs have
                         in common.
            'and'        Only neighbors shared by all input pores. Also
                         accepts 'intersection' and 'all'
            ===========  =====================================================

        asmask : boolean
            If ``False`` (default), the returned result is a list of the
            neighboring pores as indices. If ``True``, the returned result is a
            boolean mask. (Useful for labelling)

        Returns
        -------
        If ``flatten`` is ``True``, returns a 1D array of pore indices
        filtered according to the specified mode.  If ``flatten`` is
        ``False``, returns a list of lists, where each list contains the
        neighbors of the corresponding input pores.

        Notes
        -----
        The ``logic`` options are applied to neighboring pores only, thus
        it is not possible to obtain pores that are part of the global set
        but not neighbors. This is because (a) the list of global pores
        might be very large, and (b) it is not possible to return a list
        of neighbors for each input pores if global pores are considered.
