class Voronoi(DelaunayVoronoiDual):
    r"""
    Random network formed by Voronoi tessellation of arbitrary base points

    Parameters
    ----------
    points : array_like, optional
        The base points around which to generate the Voronoi tessellation.

    num_points : scalar, optional
        If ``points`` is not supplied, then this must be given.  A sent of
        randomly located points will be generated.

    shape : array_like
        The size of the domain.  It's possible to create cubic as well as 2D
        square domains by changing the ``shape`` as follows:

        [x, y, z] - will produce a normal cubic domain of dimension x, and
        and z

        [x, y, 0] - will produce a 2D square domain of size x by y

    name : string
        An optional name for the object to help identify it.  If not given,
        one will be generated.

    project : OpenPNM Project object, optional
        Each OpenPNM object must be part of a *Project*.  If none is supplied
        then one will be created and this Network will be automatically
        assigned to it.  To create a *Project* use ``openpnm.Project()``.

    Notes
    -----
    By definition these points will each lie in the center of a Voronoi cell,
    so they will not be the pore centers.  The number of pores in the
    returned network thus will differ from the number of points supplied
