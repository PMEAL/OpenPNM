class NetworkX(GenericIO):
    r"""
    NetworkX is a common tool for dealing with network structures

    This class actually handles dealing with live NetworkX objects rather than
    saved files. NetworkX has a number of export formats, so converting
    OpenPNM data to a NetworkX object, then using NetworkX to exprt might be
    an option for file formats not supported by OpenPNM yet.

    Notes
    -----
    1. Each node in a NetworkX object (i.e. ``G``) can be assigned properties
    using syntax like ``G.node[n]['diameter'] = 0.5`` where ``n`` is the
    node number.  There is no need to precede the property name with any
    indication that it is pore data such as \'pore\_\'.  OpenPNM will prepend
    \'pore.\' to each property name.

    2. Since \'pore.coords\' is so central to OpenPNM it should be specified
    in the NetworkX object as \'coords\', and the [X, Y, Z] coordinates of
    each node should be a 1x3 list.

    3. Edges in a NetworkX object are accessed using the index numbers of the
    two nodes it connects, such as ``G.adj[2][3]['length'] = 0.1``
    indicating the edge that connects nodes 2 and 3.  There is no need to
    precede the property name with any indication that it is throat data such
    as \'throat\_\'.  OpenPNM will prepend \'throat.\' to each property name.

    4. The \'throat.conns\' property is essential to OpenPNM, but this does NOT
    need to be specified explicitly as a property in NetworkX.  The
    connectivity is embedded into the network representation and is extracted
    by OpenPNM.

    @classmethod
    def from_networkx(cls, G, project=None):
        r"""
        Add data to an OpenPNM Network from a undirected NetworkX graph object.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : networkx.classes.graph.Graph Object
            The NetworkX graph. G should be undirected. The numbering of nodes
            should be numeric (int's), zero-based and should not contain any
            gaps, i.e. ``G.nodes() = [0,1,3,4,5]`` is not allowed and should be
            mapped to ``G.nodes() = [0,1,2,3,4]``.

        project : OpenPNM Project object
            A GenericNetwork is created and added to the specified Project.
            If no Project is supplied then one will be created and returned.

        Returns
        -------
        An OpenPNM Project containing a GenericNetwork with all the data from
        the NetworkX object.
