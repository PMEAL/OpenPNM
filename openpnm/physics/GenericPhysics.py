class GenericPhysics(Subdomain, ModelsMixin):
    r"""
    This generic class is meant as a starter for custom Physics objects

    It produces a blank object with no pore-scale models attached.  Users can
    add models from the ``models`` module (or create their own).

    Parameters
    ----------
    network : OpenPNM Network object
        The network to which this Physics should be attached

    phase : OpenPNM Phase object
        The Phase object to which this Physics applies

    geometry : OpenPNM Geometry object
        The Geometry object that defines the pores/throats where this Physics
        should be applied.

    name : str, optional
        A unique string name to identify the Physics object, typically same as
        instance name but can be anything.  If left blank, and name will be
        generated that include the class name and a random string.
