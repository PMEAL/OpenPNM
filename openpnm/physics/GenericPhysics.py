class GenericPhysics(Subdomain, ModelsMixin):
    r"""
    This generic class is meant as a starter for custom Physics objects

    It produces a blank object with no pore-scale models attached.  Users can
    add models from the ``models`` module (or create their own).

    Parameters
    ----------
    network : OpenPNM Network object
        The network to which this Physics should be attached

    phase : OpenPNM Phase object
        The Phase object to which this Physics applies

    geometry : OpenPNM Geometry object
        The Geometry object that defines the pores/throats where this Physics
        should be applied.

    name : str, optional
        A unique string name to identify the Physics object, typically same as
        instance name but can be anything.  If left blank, and name will be
        generated that includes the class name and an integer index.

        Sets the association between this physics and a phase.

        Parameters
        ----------
        phase : OpenPNM Phase object
            If mode is 'add' or 'swap', this must be specified so that
            associations can be recorded in the phase dictionary.  If the
            mode is 'drop', this is not needed since the existing association
            can be used to find it.
        mode : str
            Options are:

            'swap' - Associations will be made with the new phase, and
            the pore and throat locations from the current phase will be
            transferred to the new one.

            'drop' - Associations with the existing phase will be removed.

            'add' - If the physics does not presently have an associated
            phase, this will create associations, but no pore or throat
            locations will assigned.  This must be done using the
            ``set_geometry`` method.

        Notes
        -----
        In all cases the property data will be deleted since it will not
        be relevant to the new phase, so the ``regenerate_models`` method
        must be run.
