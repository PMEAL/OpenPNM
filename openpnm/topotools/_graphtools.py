def find_neighbor_sites(sites, am, flatten=True, include_input=False,
                        logic='or'):
    r"""
    Given a symmetric adjacency matrix, finds all sites that are connected
    to the input sites.

    Parameters
    ----------
    am : scipy.sparse matrix
        The adjacency matrix of the network.  Must be symmetrical such that if
        sites *i* and *j* are connected, the matrix contains non-zero values
        at locations (i, j) and (j, i).

    flatten : bool
        If ``True`` (default) the returned result is a compressed array of all
        neighbors, or a list of lists with each sub-list containing the
        neighbors for each input site.  Note that an *unflattened* list might
        be slow to generate since it is a Python ``list`` rather than a Numpy
        array.

    include_input : bool
        If ``False`` (default) the input sites will be removed from the result.

    logic : str
        Specifies logic to filter the resulting list.  Options are:

        **'or'** : (default) All neighbors of the input sites.  This is also
        known as the 'union' in set theory or 'any' in boolean logic.  Both
        keywords are accepted and treated as 'or'.

        **'xor'** : Only neighbors of one and only one input site.  This is
        useful for finding the sites that are not shared by any of the input
        sites.  'exclusive_or' is also accepted.

        **'xnor'** : Neighbors that are shared by two or more input sites. This
        is equivalent to finding all neighbors with 'or', minus those found
        with 'xor', and is useful for finding neighbors that the inputs have
        in common.  'nxor' is also accepted.

        **'and'** : Only neighbors shared by all input sites.  This is also
        known as 'intersection' in set theory and (somtimes) as 'all' in
        boolean logic.  Both keywords are accepted and treated as 'and'.

    Returns
    -------
    An array containing the neighboring sites filtered by the given logic.  If
    ``flatten`` is ``False`` then the result is a list of lists containing the
    neighbors of each input site.

    See Also
    --------
    find_complement

    Notes
    -----
    The ``logic`` options are applied to neighboring sites only, thus it is not
    possible to obtain sites that are part of the global set but not neighbors.
    This is because (a) the list global sites might be very large, and (b) it
    is not possible to return a list of neighbors for each input site if global
    sites are considered.

    am : scipy.sparse matrix (optional)
        The adjacency matrix of the network. Either ``am`` or ``im`` must be
        given.  Passing in ``am`` is faster, but does not allow for an
        unflattened list.

    shape : list, optional

    drop_diag : bool
        If True (default), then connections from a site and itself are removed.

    drop_dupes : bool
        If True (default), then all pairs of sites sharing multiple connections
        are reduced to a single connection.

    drop_negs : bool
        If True (default), then all connections with one or both ends pointing
        to a negative number are removed.
