def find_neighbor_sites(sites, am, flatten=True, include_input=True,
                        logic='or'):
    r"""
    Given a symmetric adjacency matrix, finds all sites that are connected
    to the input sites.

    Parameters
    ----------
    am : scipy.sparse matrix
        The adjacency matrix of the network.  Must be symmetrical such that if
        sites *i* and *j* are connected, the matrix contains non-zero values
        at locations (i, j) and (j, i).

    flatten : boolean
        If ``True`` (default) the returned result is a compressed array of all
        neighbors, or a list of lists with each sub-list containing the
        neighbors for each input site.  Note that an *unflattened* list might
        be slow to generate since it is a Python ``list`` rather than a Numpy
        array.

    include_input : boolean
        If ``False`` (default) the input sites will be removed from the result.

    logic : string
        Specifies logic to filter the resulting list.  Options are:

        **'or'** : (default) All neighbors of the input sites.  This is also
        known as the 'union' in set theory or 'any' in boolean logic.  Both
        keywords are accepted and treated as 'or'.

        **'xor'** : Only neighbors of one and only one input site.  This is
        useful for finding the sites that are not shared by any of the input
        sites.

        **'xnor'** : Neighbors that are shared by two or more input sites. This
        is equivalent to finding all neighbors with 'or', minus those found
        with 'xor', and is useful for finding neighbors that the inputs have
        in common.

        **'and'** : Only neighbors shared by all input sites.  This is also
        known as 'intersection' in set theory and (somtimes) as 'all' in
        boolean logic.  Both keywords are accepted and treated as 'and'.

    Returns
    -------
    An array containing the neighboring sites filtered by the given logic.  If
    ``flatten`` is ``False`` then the result is a list of lists containing the
    neighbors of each input site.

    See Also
    --------
    find_complement

    Notes
    -----
    The ``logic`` options are applied to neighboring sites only, thus it is not
    possible to obtain sites that are part of the global set but not neighbors.
    This is because (a) the list global sites might be very large, and (b) it
    is not possible to return a list of neighbors for each input site if global
    sites are considered.

        treated as the radius [r] of a sphere centered on [0, 0, 0].

        **cylinder** : If a two-element list is received it's treated as
        the radius and height of a cylinder [r, z] whose central axis
        starts at [0, 0, 0] and extends in the positive z-direction.

        **rectangle** : If a three element list is received, it's treated
        as the outer corner of rectangle [x, y, z] whose opposite corner
        lies at [0, 0, 0].

    Find the pores on the surface of the domain by performing a Delaunay
    triangulation between the network pores and some external ``markers``. All
    pores connected to these external marker points are considered surface
    pores.

    Parameters
    ----------
    network: OpenPNM Network Object
        The network for which the surface pores are to be found

    markers: array_like
        3 x N array of the marker coordiantes to use in the triangulation.  The
        labeling is performed in one step, so all points are added, and then
        any pores connected to at least one marker is given the provided label.
        By default, this function will automatically generate 6 points outside
        each axis of the network domain.

        Users may wish to specify a single external marker point and provide an
        appropriate label in order to identify specific faces.  For instance,
        the marker may be *above* the domain, and the label might be
        'top_surface'.

    label : string
        The label to apply to the pores.  The default is 'surface'.

    Notes
    -----
    This function does not check whether the given markers actually lie outside
    the domain, allowing the labeling of *internal* sufaces.

    If this method fails to mark some surface pores, consider sending more
    markers on each face.

    Examples

    >>> op.topotools.find_surface_pores(network=net)

    When cubic networks are created, the surfaces are already labeled:

    >>> net.num_pores(['top','bottom', 'left', 'right', 'front','back'])

def stitch(network, donor, P_network, P_donor, method='nearest',
           len_max=sp.inf, len_min=0, label_suffix=''):
    r'''
    Stitches a second a network to the current network.

    Parameters
    ----------
    networK : OpenPNM Network Object
        The Network to which to donor Network will be attached

    donor : OpenPNM Network Object
        The Network to stitch on to the current Network

    P_network : array_like
        The pores on the current Network

    P_donor : array_like
        The pores on the donor Network

    label_suffix : string or None
        Some text to append to each label in the donor Network before
        inserting them into the recipient.  The default is to append no
        text, but a common option would be to append the donor Network's
        name. To insert none of the donor labels, use None.

    len_max : float
        Set a length limit on length of new throats

    method : string (default = 'delaunay')
        The method to use when making pore to pore connections. Options are:

        - 'delaunay' : Use a Delaunay tessellation
        - 'nearest' : Connects each pore on the receptor network to its nearest
                      pore on the donor network

    Notes
    -----
    Before stitching it is necessary to translate the pore coordinates of
    one of the Networks so that it is positioned correctly relative to the
    other.

    pores1 : array_like
        The first group of pores on the network

    pores2 : array_like
        The second group of pores on the network

    labels : list of strings
        The labels to apply to the new throats.  This argument is only needed
        if ``add_conns`` is True.

    add_conns : bool
        Indicates whether the connections should be added to the supplied
        network (default is True).  Otherwise, the connections are returned
        as an Nt x 2 array that can be passed directly to ``extend``.

    Parameters
    ----------

    certain distance of a given pore, and these can then be merged without
    causing any abnormal connections.

def generate_base_points(num_points, domain_size, density_map=None,
                         reflect=True):
    r"""
    Generates a set of base points for passing into the Tessellation-based
    Network classes.  The points can be distributed in spherical, cylindrical,
    or rectilinear patterns, as well as 2D and 3D (disks and squares).

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_points : scalar
        The number of base points that lie within the domain.  Note that the
        actual number of points returned will be larger, with the extra points
        lying outside the domain.

    domain_size : list or array
        Controls the size and shape of the domain, as follows:

        **sphere** : If a single value is received, its treated as the radius
        [r] of a sphere centered on [0, 0, 0].

        **cylinder** : If a two-element list is received it's treated as the
        radius and height of a cylinder [r, z] positioned at [0, 0, 0] and
        extending in the positive z-direction.  If the z dimension is 0, a
        disk of radius r is created.

        **rectangle** : If a three element list is received, it's treated
        as the outer corner of rectangle [x, y, z] whose opposite corner lies
        at [0, 0, 0].  If the z dimension is 0, a rectangle of size X-by-Y is
        created.

    density_map : array, optional
        A an array that contains fractional values (0 < i < 1) indicating the
        liklihood that a point in that region should be kept.  The size of this
        array can be anything, but the shape must match the ``domain_size``;
        that is for a 3D network the shape of the ``density_map`` can be
        [10, 10, 10] or [50, 50, 50], depending on how important the resolution
        of the density distribution is.  For a 2D network the ``density_map``
        should be [10, 10].

        When specifying a custom probabiliy map is it recommended to also set
        values outside the given domain to zero.  If not, then the correct
        shape will still be returned, but with too few points in it.

    reflect : boolean
        If True, the the base points are generated as specified, the reflected
        about each face of the domain.  This essentially tricks the
        tessellation functions into creating smooth flat faces at the
        boundaries once these excess pores are trimmed.

    Notes
    -----
    The reflection approach tends to create larger pores near the surfaces, so
    it might be necessary to use the ``density_map`` argument to specify a
    slightly higher density of points near the surfaces.

    The ``Voronoi``, ``Delaunay``, ``Gabriel``, and ``DelunayVoronoiDual``
    classes can *techncially* handle base points with spherical or cylindrical
    domains, but the reflection across round surfaces does not create perfect
    Voronoi cells so the surfaces will not be smooth.


    Examples
    --------
    The following generates a spherical array with higher values near the core.
    It uses a distance transform to create a sphere of radius 10, then a
    second distance transform to create larger values in the center away from
    the sphere surface.  These distance values could be further skewed by
    applying a power, with values higher than 1 resulting in higher values in
    the core, and fractional values smoothinging them out a bit.

        **sphere** : If a single value is received, its treated as the radius
        [r] of a sphere centered on [0, 0, 0].

        **cylinder** : If a two-element list is received it's treated as the
        radius and height of a cylinder [r, z] positioned at [0, 0, 0] and
        extending in the positive z-direction.  If the z dimension is 0, a
        disk of radius r is created.

        **rectangle** : If a three element list is received, it's treated
        as the outer corner of rectangle [x, y, z] whose opposite corner lies
        at [0, 0, 0].  If the z dimension is 0, a rectangle of size X-by-Y is

    mask : array_like, boolean
        A list of active bonds or sites (throats or pores).  If the mask is

    Find the shortest path between pairs of pores.

    Parameters
    ----------
    network : OpenPNM Network Object
        The Network object on which the search should be performed

    pore_pairs : array_like
        An N x 2 array containing N pairs of pores for which the shortest
        path is sought.

    weights : array_like, optional
        An Nt-long list of throat weights for the search.  Typically this
