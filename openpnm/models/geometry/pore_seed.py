Pore seed models are use to calculate random numbers for each pore, which can
subsequently be used in statistical distributions to calculate actual pore
sizes.

def spatially_correlated(target, weights=None, strel=None):
    r"""
    Generates pore seeds that are spatailly correlated with their neighbors.

    Parameters
    ----------
    target : OpenPNM Object
        The object which this model is associated with. This controls the
        length of the calculated array, and also provides access to other
        necessary properties.

    weights : list of ints, optional
        The [Nx,Ny,Nz] distances (in number of pores) in each direction that
        should be correlated.

    strel : array_like, optional (in place of weights)
        The option allows full control over the spatial correlation pattern by
        specifying the structuring element to be used in the convolution.

        The array should be a 3D array containing the strength of correlations
        in each direction.  Nonzero values indicate the strength, direction
        and extent of correlations.  The following would achieve a basic
        correlation in the z-direction:

    ::

        strel = np.array([[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]],
                          [[0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0]],
                          [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]])

    Returns
    -------
    values : NumPy ndarray
        Array containing pore seed values.

    Notes
    -----
    This approach uses image convolution to replace each pore seed in the
    geoemtry with a weighted average of those around it.  It then converts the
    new seeds back to a random distribution by assuming they new seeds are
    normally distributed.

    Because is uses image analysis tools, it only works on Cubic networks.

    This is the appproached used by Gostick et al [2]_ to create an anistropic
    gas diffusion layer for fuel cell electrodes.
