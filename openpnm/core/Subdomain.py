class Subdomain(Base, LegacyMixin, LabelMixin):
    r"""
    This subclass of the Base class provides the ability assign the object
    to specific locations (pores and throats) in the domain.  This class
    is subclassed by GenericGeometry and GenericPhysics.

    Notes
    -----
    The Project object has two methods, ``check_geometry_health`` and
    ``check_physics_health`` that look to make sure all locations are
    assigned to one and only one Geometry and/or Physics.
