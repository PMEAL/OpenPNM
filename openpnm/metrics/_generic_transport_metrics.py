            The pores where the inlet boundary conditions were applied. If
            not given an attempt is made to infer them from the algorithm.

        domain_area : float
            The area of the inlet and/or outlet face (which shold match)
        domain_length : float
            The length of the domain between the inlet and outlet faces
