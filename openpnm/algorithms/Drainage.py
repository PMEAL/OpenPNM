class Drainage(GenericAlgorithm):
    r"""
    Simulates a capillary drainage experiment by applying a list of increasing
    capillary pressures and invading all throats that are accessible and
    invadable at the given pressure.

    Parameters
    ----------
    network : OpenPNM Network Object
        The network upon which the simulation will be run

    name : string (optional)
        The name to apply to the Algorithm for quick identification

    Notes
    -----
    This algorithm creates several arrays and adds them to its own dictionary.
    These include:

    **'pore(throat).inv_Pc'** : The applied capillary pressure at which each
    pore(throat) was invaded.

    **'pore(throat).inv_Seq'** : The sequence each pore(throat) was filled.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import openpnm as op
    >>> pn = op.network.Cubic(shape=[20, 20, 20], spacing=10)
    >>> pn.add_boundary_pores(labels='top')
    >>> geo = op.geometry.StickAndBall(network=pn, pores=pn.Ps, throats=pn.Ts)
    >>> water = op.phases.Water(network=pn)
    >>> air = op.phases.Air(network=pn)
    >>> phys = op.physics.GenericPhysics(network=pn, phase=water, geometry=geo)
    >>> phys.add_model(propname='throat.capillary_pressure',
    ...                model=op.models.physics.capillary_pressure.washburn)

    Once the basic Core objects are setup, the Algorithm can be created and
    and run as follows:

    >>> alg = op.algorithms.Drainage(network=pn)
    >>> alg.setup(invading_phase=water, defending_phase=air)
    >>> alg.set_inlets(pores=pn.pores('top'))
    >>> alg.run()
    >>> data = alg.get_drainage_data()

    The ``data`` variable is a dictionary containing the numerical values of
    the resultant capillary pressure curve.  The available values can be
    inspected by typing ``data.keys()`` at the command line. These values can
    of course be plotted with matplotlib or exported to a graphing program of
    your choice.

    The final step is to utilize these results elsewhere in your OpenPNM
    simulation.  All Algorithms possess a method called ``return_results``
    which as the name suggests send the results to the correct locations.  For
    the 'Drainage Algorithm' this works as follows:

    >>> alg.return_results(Pc=5000)

    This command determines which pores and throats were filled at the applied
    capillary pressure of 5000, and creates 'pore.occupancy' and
    'throat.occupancy' arrays on the Phase object that was specfied as the
    'invading_phase' in the ``setup_method``.

        Parameters
        ----------
        invading_phase : OpenPNM Phase object
            The Phase object containing the physical properties of the invading
            fluid.

        defending_phase : OpenPNM Phase object
            The Phase object containing the physical properties of the

        entry_pressure : string (optional)
            The dictionary key on the Phase object where the throat entry
            pressure values can be found.  The default is
            'throat.capillary_pressure'.

        trapping : boolean (optional)
            Specifies whether defending phase trapping should be included or
            not. The default is False.  Note that defending phase outlets can
            be specified using the ``set_outlets`` method.  Otherwise it is
            assumed the defending phase has no outlets.

        pore_filling and throat_filling: string (optional)
            The dictionary key on the Physics object where the late pore or
            throat filling model is located. The default is None, meaning that
            a pore or throat is completely filled upon penetration.

        pore_volume and throat_volume : string (optional)
            The dictionary key on the Geometry object where the pore or throat
            volume data is located.  The defaults is 'pore.volume' and

        Set the locations from which the invading phase enters the network.

        Parameters
        ----------
        pores : array_like
            An array of pore numbers that are initially filled with invading
            phase, and from which clusters of invading phase grow and invade
            into the network.

        mode : string
            Controls how the new values are handled.  Options are:

            **'add'** : (default) Adds the newly recieved locations to any
            existing locations.  This is useful for incrementally adding
            inlets.

            **'overwrite'** : Deletes any present locations and adds new ones.
            This is useful for fixing mistaken inlets, or rerunning the

            **'remove'** : Removes the received locations from the list of
            inlet pores.

        Notes
        -----
        The 'inlet' pores are initially filled with invading fluid to start the
        simulation.  To avoid the capillary pressure curve showing a non-zero
        starting saturation at low pressures, it is necessary to create
        boundary pores that have zero-volume, and set these as the inlets.

            **'remove'** : Removes the received locations from the list of

        Notes
        -----
        Setting pores as initially filled only affects the saturation at the
        start of the capillary pressure curve since pre-filled pores do not
        contribute to the invasion process.  Setting throats as filled,
        however, has a significant impact on the subsequent invasion since
        these throats act as bridges to the percolation process.  Of course,
        they also contribute to the starting saturation as well.
