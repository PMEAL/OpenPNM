class InvasionPercolation(GenericAlgorithm):
    r"""
    A classic/basic invasion percolation algorithm optimized for speed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    network : OpenPNM Network object
        The Network upon which the invasion will occur.

    Notes
    ----
    This algorithm uses a binary heap to store all a list of all accessible
    throats, sorted according to entry pressure.  This means that item [0] in
    the heap is the most easily invaded throat, so looking up which throat
    to invade next is computationally trivial.  In order to keep the list
    sorted new throats to the list takes more time, however, the heap data
    structure is very efficient at this.  Interested users can consult the
    wikipedia page on `binary heaps
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap>`_ for more information.


    Examples
    --------
    Start by importing the usual packages:

    >>> import openpnm as op
    >>> import scipy as sp
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    Create 2D cubic network for easier visualizaiton:

    >>> S = np.array([100, 100, 1])
    >>> pn = op.network.Cubic(shape=S, spacing=0.0001, name='pn11')

    Add a basic geometry:

    >>> geom = op.geometry.StickAndBall(network=pn, pores=pn.Ps, throats=pn.Ts)

    Create an invading phase, and attach the capillary pressure model:

    >>> water = op.phases.Water(network=pn)
    >>> water.add_model(propname='throat.entry_pressure',
    ...                 model=op.models.physics.capillary_pressure.washburn)

    Initialize an invasion percolation object and define inlets:

    >>> ip = op.algorithms.InvasionPercolation(network=pn)
    >>> ip.setup(phase=water)
    >>> ip.set_inlets(pores=0)
    >>> ip.run()

    After running the algorithm the invading phase configuration at a given
    saturation can be obtained and assigned to the phase object:

    >>> water.update(ip.results(Snwp=0.5))

    Because it was a 2D network it's easy to quickly visualize the invasion
    pattern as an image for verification:

    .. note::

        Because the network is 2D and cubic, an image can be generated with
        color corresponding to a value.  The following plots the entire
        invasion sequence, and the water configuraiton at Snwp = 0.5.

        ``plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)``

        ``plt.imshow(np.reshape(ip['pore.invasion_sequence'], newshape=S[S > 1]))``

        Apply trapping based on algorithm described by Y. Masson [1].
        It is applied as a post-process and runs the percolation algorithm in
        reverse assessing the occupancy of pore neighbors. Consider the
        following scenario when running standard IP without trapping,
        3 situations can happen after each invasion step:

            * The number of defending clusters stays the same and clusters can
            shrink
            * A cluster of size one is suppressed
            * A cluster is split into multiple clusters

        In reverse the following opposite situations can happen:

            * The number of defending clusters stays the same and clusters can
            grow
            * A cluster of size one is created
            * Mutliple clusters merge into one cluster

        With trapping the reversed rules are adjusted so that only clusters
        that do not connect to a sink can grow and merge. At the point that a
        neighbor connected to a sink is touched the trapped cluster stops
        growing as this is the point of trapping in forward invasion time.

        Logger info displays the invasion sequence and pore index and a message
        with condition number based on the modified trapping rules and the
        assignment of the pore to a given cluster.

        Initially all invaded pores are given cluster label -1
        Outlets / Sinks are given -2
        New clusters that grow into fully trapped clusters are either
        identified at the point of breakthrough or grow from nothing if the
        full invasion sequence is run, they are assigned numbers from 0 up.

        Notes
        -----
        (1) ``idx`` and ``indptr`` are properties are the network's incidence
        matrix, and are used to quickly find neighbor throats.

        (2) Numba doesn't like forein data types (i.e. GenericNetwork), and so
        ``find_neighbor_throats`` method cannot be called in a jitted method.

        (3) Nested wrapper is for performance issues (reduced OpenPNM import)
        time due to local numba import
