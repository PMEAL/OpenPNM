        This method takes several arguments that are essential to running the
        algorithm and adds them to the settings

        Parameters
        ----------
        phase : OpenPNM Phase object
            The phase on which the algorithm is to be run. If no value is
            given, the existing value is kept.

        quantity : string
            The name of the physical quantity to be calcualted such as
            ``'pore.xxx'``.

        conductance : string
            The name of the pore-scale transport conductance values. These
            are typically calculated by a model attached to a *Physics* object
            associated with the given *Phase*. Example; ``'throat.yyy'``.

        r_tolerance : scalar
            Tolerance to achieve. The solver returns a solution when 'residual'
            falls below 'r_tolerance'. The default value is 0.001.

        max_iter : scalar
            The maximum number of iterations the solver can perform to find
            a solution. The default value is 5000.

        relaxation_source : scalar, between 0 and 1
            A relaxation factor to control under-relaxation of the source term.
            Factor approaching 0 : improved stability but slow simulation.
            Factor approaching 1 : fast simulation but may be unstable.
            Default value is 1 (no under-relaxation).

        relaxation_quantity :  scalar, between 0 and 1
            A relaxation factor to control under-relaxation for the quantity
            solving for.
            Factor approaching 0 : improved stability but slow simulation.
            Factor approaching 1 : fast simulation but may be unstable.
            Default value is 1 (no under-relaxation).

        Notes
        -----
        Under-relaxation is a technique used for improving stability of a
        computation, particularly in the presence of highly non-linear terms.
        Under-relaxation used here limits the change in a variable from one
        iteration to the next. An optimum choice of the relaxation factor is
        one that is small enough to ensure stable simulation and large enough
        to speed up the computation.
