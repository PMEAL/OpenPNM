Installation Instructions 
###############################################################################

OpenPNM does not need to be installed because it does not need to be compiled.  It is only necessary to download a zip file containing the package, and have a functioning Python installation.  

OpenPNM utilizes Python 3 with Scipy 0.14 and Matplotlib.  OpenPNM outputs many of its results in the vtk format which is conveniently visualized with Paraview.  

The code is hosted on Github so it is also useful to have a Git client installed that can download the repository.  

The installation of these requirements on specific platforms is described below.

Windows Instructions
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The simplest way to get Python, Scipy and Matplotlib is to download the `WinPython <http://code.google.com/p/winpython/>`_ package.  This package also comes with `Spyder <http://code.google.com/p/spyderlib/>`_, which provides an integrated development environment (IDE) that is very similar to Matlab, with an editor, command console, variable explorer and so on combined into the same window.  

Another useful tool is `Sourcetree <http://sourcetreeapp.com>`_ which provides a good interface to Github hosted repositories.  

Finally, it is also suggested to download `Paraview <http://www.paraview.org/>`_ for visualizing the networks produced by OpenPNM.
