Preparing Your System
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OpenPNM utilizes Python 2.7 with Scipy 0.14 and Matplotlib.  OpenPNM outputs many of its results in the vtk format which is conveniently visualized with Paraview.  

The code is hosted on Github so it is also useful to have a Git client installed that can download the repository.  

OpenPNM plans to upgrade to Python 3.3 in the very near future, once the basic functionality is pinned down and v1.0 is released.  

The installation of these requirements on specific platforms is described below.

Windows Instructions
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The simplest way to get Python, Scipy and Matplotlib is to download the `WinPython <http://code.google.com/p/winpython/>`_ package.  This package also comes with `Spyder <http://code.google.com/p/spyderlib/>`_, which provides an integrated development environment (IDE) that is very similar to Matlab, with an editor, command console, variable explorer and so on combined into the same window.  

Another useful tool is `Sourcetree <http://sourcetreeapp.com>`_ which provides a good interface to Github hosted repositories.  

Finally, it is also suggested to download `Paraview <http://www.paraview.org/>`_ for visualizing the networks produced by OpenPNM.

Setting Up the Code
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The source code for OpenPNM is hosted on `Github <http://github.com/PMEAL/OpenPNM>`_.  You can download this code as a zip file or 'clone' the repository into your Git client (as as `Sourcetree <http://sourcetreeapp.com>`_).  These files can be located at a location of your preference, such as C:\\user\\documents\\code\\OpenPNM.
