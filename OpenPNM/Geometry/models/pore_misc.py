def constant(geometry, value, **kwargs):

    Assign specified constant value to all pores on the specifed Geometry
    object.

    Parameters
    ----------
    geometry : OpenPNM Geometry object
        The Geometry object to which this model will apply.  This is necessary
        to determine the length of the array to generate.

    value : scalar
        The scalar value to be applied

    Notes
    -----
    This function is redundant and could be accomplished with
    geometry['pore.prop'] = value.  This model was added to the code before
    this type of assignment was possible, and is only kept for backwards
    compatibility.

def random(geometry, seed=None, num_range=[0, 1], **kwargs):
    r"""
    Generate an array of random numbers using the Scipy random number
    generator.

    Parameters
    ----------
    geometry : OpenPNM Geometry object
        This is required to determine the length of the array to generate

    seed : int
        The seed value to initialize the random number generator.  The default
        is None which means different numbers will be produced each time this
        function is run.

    num_range : list
        The min and max values of the returned random numbers.  The values will
        be uniformly distributed over this range.

    Notes
    -----
    This method seems trivial but it can be useful to add this as a pore-scale
    model so that random number can be regenerated upon demand to create
    new realization of the pore and throat size distributions (i.e. assuming
    ``seed`` is not set to None).

    Parameters
    ----------
    geometry : OpenPNM Geometry Object
        The object containing the ``throat_prop`` to be used.

    throat_prop : string
        The dictionary key of the array containing the throat property to be
        used in the calculation.  The default is 'throat.seed'.
