    Genrate spatially correlated pore seeds by calculating distance from random
    locations (inclusions) in the domain

    Parameters
    ----------
    p : float
        The fraction of pores in the domain that are set as 'seeds' for the
        distance calculation

    Returns
    -------
    A list of distance values (in voxels) between each pore and it nearest
    seed pore.  A list of voxel distances is returned rather than normalized
    seeds between 0:1 so that the user can manipulate the map as desired, by
    applying desired thresholds and/or scaling to get 0:1 seeds.

    Notes
    -----
    - This method uses image analysis tools, so only works on Cubic networks
    - At present the result contains edge artifacts since no inclusions are
    present beyond the image boundary

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import OpenPNM
    >>> pn = OpenPNM.Network.Cubic(shape=[50, 50, 50])
    >>> geom = OpenPNM.Geometry.GenericGeometry(network=pn, pores=pn.Ps,
    ...                                         throats=pn.Ts)
    >>> model = OpenPNM.Geometry.models.pore_seed.distance_from_inclusion
    >>> geom.add_model(propname='pore.seed', model=model, p=0.001)
    >>> im = pn.asarray(geom['pore.seed'])

    Visualizing the end result can be done with:

    .. code-block:: python

        matplotlib.pyplot.imshow(im[:,25,:],interpolation='none')

def spatially_correlated(geometry, weights=None, strel=None, **kwargs):
    r"""
    Generates pore seeds that are spatailly correlated with their neighbors.

    Parameters
    ----------
    geometry : OpenPNM Geometry object
        The Geometry object with which this model is associated.  This is
        needed to determine the size of the array to create.

    weights : list of ints, optional
        The [Nx,Ny,Nz] distances (in number of pores) in each direction that
        should be correlated.

    strel : array_like, optional (in place of weights)
        The option allows full control over the spatial correlation pattern by
        specifying the structuring element to be used in the convolution.

        The array should be a 3D array containing the strength of correlations
        in each direction.  Nonzero values indicate the strength, direction
        and extent of correlations.  The following would achieve a basic
        correlation in the z-direction:

        strel = sp.array([[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]], \
                          [[0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0]], \
                          [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]])

    Notes
    -----
    This approach uses image convolution to replace each pore seed in the
    geoemtry with a weighted average of those around it.  It then converts the
    new seeds back to a random distribution by assuming they new seeds are
    normally distributed.

    Because is uses image analysis tools, it only works on Cubic networks.

    This is the appproached used by Gostick et al [2]_ to create an anistropic
    gas diffusion layer for fuel cell electrodes.

def location_adjusted(network, geometry, image=None, **kwargs):
    r"""
    Use an image to adjust randomly generated seed values based on their location

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : ndarray (3-dimensional)
        values between 0.0 and 1.0 which are used to multiply the seed number by.

    Notes
    ----------
    The shape of the image reflects the relative position of the pore in the
    geometry. The image shape does not have to equal the domain shape.
    For example passing in a [2, 2, 2] image divides the domain into equal eigths
    and if image[0, 0, 0] == 0.5 the pores in the bottom front left section have
    their seed values halved.
