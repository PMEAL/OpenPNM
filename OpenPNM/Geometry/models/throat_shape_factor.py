    Mortensen et al. have shown that the Hagen-Poiseuille hydraluic resistance is
    linearly dependent on the compactness. Defined as perimeter^2/area.
    The dependence is not universal as shapes with sharp corners provide more
    resistance than those that are more elliptical. Count the number of vertices
    and apply the right correction.
