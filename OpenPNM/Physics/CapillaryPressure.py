def Washburn(net,sigma=0.072,theta=120.0):
    r"""
    Computes the capillary entry pressure assuming the throat is a cylindrical tube.

    Parameters
    ----------
    network : OpenPNM Network Object
        The network on which to apply the calculation

    sigma : float, array_like
        Surface tension of the invading/defending fluid pair.
        Units must be consistent with the throat size values, but SI is encouraged.

    theta : float, array_like
        Contact angle formed by a droplet of the invading fluid and solid surface, measured through the defending fluid phase.
        Angle must be given in degrees.

    Notes
    -----
    The Washburn equation is:

    .. math::
        P_c = -\frac{2\sigma(cos(\theta))}{r}

    This is the most basic approach to calcualing entry pressure and is suitable for highly non-wetting invading fluids in most materials.

def Purcell(net,sigma,theta,r_toroid):
    r"""
    Computes the throat capillary entry pressure assuming the throat is a toroid.

    Parameters
    ----------
    network : OpenPNM Network Object
        The network on which to apply the calculation

    sigma : float, array_like
        Surface tension of the invading/defending fluid pair.  Units must be consistent with the throat size values, but SI is encouraged.

    theta : float, array_like
        Contact angle formed by a droplet of the invading fluid and solid surface, measured through the defending fluid phase.  Angle must be given in degrees.

    r_toroid : float or array_like
        The radius of the solid

    Notes
    -----
    This approach accounts for the converging-diverging nature of many throat types.  Advancing the meniscus beyond the apex of the toroid requires an increase in capillary pressure beyond that for a cylindical tube of the same radius. The details of this equation are described by Mason and Morrow [1]_, and explored by Gostick [2]_ in the context of a pore network model.

    Parameters
    ----------
    network : OpenPNM Network Object

    Notes
    -----
    Mason and Morrow compared the Purcell toroid to experimental data on various sized monodisperse PTFE beads.  They found that data could be approximated decently by simply scaling the contact angle measured through the wetting phase by 2/3.
